## Unreleased

### ⚖️ Licensing

- **Relicensed from AGPL-3.0 → dual MIT OR GPL-3.0.** TFactory is now
  available under the recipient's choice of either license. See
  `LICENSE`, `LICENSE-MIT`, and `LICENSE-GPL`. SPDX identifier:
  `MIT OR GPL-3.0-only`. The `dataseek.team` enterprise-licensing
  contact line (which referenced a non-existent email) was removed.

### 🏷️ Branding

- **Rebrand `dataseeek` → `olafkfreund`.** The `dataseeek` GitHub org
  doesn't exist; every reference in non-archive files was rewritten to
  point at the actual repo location (`olafkfreund/TFactory`) and the
  actual GitHub Pages URL (`olafkfreund.github.io/TFactory`). Affects
  README badges, docusaurus config, package.json URLs, demo repo path,
  cosign verify identity in image-mirroring drills, and ghcr.io image
  paths in the Helm chart docs.

### 📚 Documentation

- **Full docs rewrite + GitHub Pages site.** The `guides/` directory was
  archived to `docs-archive/2026-05-26/guides/` (git history preserved).
  A fresh Docusaurus site at `docs/` is published to
  <https://olafkfreund.github.io/TFactory/> via a new
  `.github/workflows/docs.yml` workflow. Includes 18 reorganized pages:
  Getting Started, Demo, Concepts (3), Architecture (3 with Mermaid
  diagrams), Wiki (FAQ/Troubleshooting/Glossary), Showcase, Compliance
  (SOC2/GDPR), Contributing, Roadmap. The legacy `guides/` content is
  unchanged in archive form and still searchable via `git log --follow`.

- **README.md slimmed from 557 to 115 lines.** Hero + tagline + 60-second
  quickstart + demo callout + screenshot grid + prominent docs links.
  Everything operational moved to the docs site.

### ✨ Added

- **`scripts/demo.sh`** — end-to-end demo runner (Bash + jq + gh).
  Seeds `olafkfreund/tfactory-demo` with 3 issues, registers the repo
  with your portal, imports the issues as backlog tasks, prompts you
  to drive Claude Code from the terminal, then kicks off an autonomous
  build. Flags: `--yolo`, `--no-reset`, `--portal=URL`.

- **`scripts/capture-screenshots.ts`** — Playwright headless Chromium
  driver that captures 14 named PNGs of the marquee portal views to
  `docs/static/img/screenshots/`. Reproducible — anyone can refresh
  the gallery with `npm -w apps/frontend-web run capture-screenshots`.

- **`Justfile`** — canonical command index. `just --list` shows
  `install`, `backend`, `frontend`, `docs-dev`, `demo`, `screenshots`,
  `test-backend`, `test-frontend`, `test-postgres`, `test-all`.

- **Root `package.json` scripts**: `docs:install`, `docs:dev`,
  `docs:build`, `demo`, `screenshots`.

## 3.0.2 - 2026-05-26

Patch release fixing two leftover wiring + branding bugs from v3.0.0.

### 🛠️ Fixed

- **P6 observability never wired into `main.py`**. The
  `server/observability/` package shipped in v3.0.0 (Epic #26 P6)
  but `main.create_app()` never called `install_metrics(app)`,
  `configure_structlog()`, or `app.add_middleware(CorrelationIdMiddleware)`.
  As a result the production portal exposed neither `/metrics` nor
  structured JSON logs nor correlation IDs — despite all P6 unit
  tests passing (they built their own minimal FastAPI app and called
  the functions directly, bypassing main.py). v3.0.2 wires the three
  calls in the correct order:
  - `configure_structlog()` at the top of `create_app()` so
    boot-time logs are already JSON.
  - `CorrelationIdMiddleware` added LAST so it's the outermost
    layer (sets X-Request-ID before TokenAuth runs; 401 responses
    still carry the ID — auditors rely on this).
  - `install_metrics(app)` after all routers are mounted so the
    Prometheus instrumentator can derive cardinality-capped
    `handler` labels from the route table.

  Regression test added at `tests/obs/test_p6_main_wiring.py`:
  imports `main.create_app()` and asserts `/metrics` returns 200 +
  CorrelationIdMiddleware echoes back `X-Request-ID` + the FastAPI
  app title is TFactory + `app.version` matches the package version.
  Gates every PR forward.

- **Leftover Magestic branding in `main.py`**. The v3.0.0 rebrand
  missed three string constants:
  - `title="Magestic AI Web API"` → `"TFactory Web API"`
  - `description="Web API for Magestic AI autonomous coding framework"`
    → `"Web API for TFactory — self-hosted AI task management +
    agent orchestration"`
  - Root-route message `"Magestic AI Web Server"` →
    `"TFactory Web Server"`

  Plus the hardcoded `version="1.0.0"` on the FastAPI app + on
  `/api/health` was a drift hazard. v3.0.2 reads the canonical
  version from `apps/backend/__init__.py` at startup (the file
  `bump-version.js` already updates on every release), via a tiny
  `_read_app_version()` helper. No more silent version-skew.

### Upgrade notes

- Backwards-compatible patch: `helm upgrade tfactory --version 3.0.2`
  picks up both fixes with no schema or config changes.
- Operators who deployed v3.0.1 had a non-functional `/metrics`
  endpoint. After upgrading, configure your Prometheus scrape job
  against the now-live endpoint (see `docs-archive/2026-05-26/guides/operations/observability.md`).

## 3.0.1 - 2026-05-26

Patch release with two operator-visible fixes.

### 🛠️ Fixed

- **SQLite migration crash on fresh install**. The P2.3
  `encrypt_credentials` migration (`c6e3b2d4a8f0`) used a direct
  `op.alter_column(nullable=False)` to re-apply the NOT NULL
  constraint on `email_accounts.access_token` after the encrypted-
  column swap. SQLite doesn't support `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER
  COLUMN ... SET NOT NULL` — backends booting against a fresh
  SQLite (`autoApply=true` in the Helm chart's POC path; default
  local-dev path) crashed during `alembic upgrade head`. Wrapped
  the step in `op.batch_alter_table`, mirroring P3.3's
  `d8f1a3c5e7b9` migration. Postgres deployments are unaffected
  (their behavior was correct via the same native ALTER).
  Regression test added at `tests/secrets/test_p2_sqlite_migration.py`
  that runs `alembic upgrade head` against a temp SQLite file —
  gates every PR going forward.

- **TFactory logo not displaying in the sidebar/loading screen/
  onboarding**. The new logo + favicon assets were stashed before
  P1 work began and never restored to the main release. Bundle
  contains the updated `logo.png` (547 KB, full-res TFactory
  brand), `favicon.ico` (15 KB), `apple-touch-icon.png` (43 KB),
  and 16/32 px favicon variants. The sidebar `<img src="/logo.png">`
  reference is unchanged — the new files just slot in.

### Upgrade notes

- **Operators on v3.0.0**: this is a backwards-compatible patch.
  `helm upgrade` to v3.0.1 picks up both fixes.
- **Operators who already migrated** (the SQLite migration crash
  blocked them from getting that far on v3.0.0): no special
  handling needed — fresh install + `helm install tfactory --version 3.0.1`
  works end-to-end.

## 3.0.0 - 2026-05-26

The TFactory **enterprise GA** release (Epic #26). Self-hosted Helm
chart with PSS-restricted defaults, encrypted-at-rest secrets backed
by 5 KMS backends, OIDC SSO, tamper-evident audit chain, GDPR
right-to-erasure, structured-JSON observability + Prometheus
metrics, and a full SOC 2 / GDPR / STRIDE evidence pack with three
ship-readiness drill scripts.

### ⚠ Breaking changes

- **Forward-only schema migration** `c6e3b2d4a8f0_encrypt_credentials`:
  `email_accounts.access_token`, `email_accounts.refresh_token`, and
  `llm_endpoints.api_key` columns convert from plaintext `Text` to
  encrypted `LargeBinary`. The migration is **forward-only** — there
  is no downgrade path. Operators MUST take a `pg_dump` backup before
  upgrading from any v2.x install.
- **Required Postgres backend for production**: SQLite remains
  supported for dev/POC, but `kms_data_keys` + the audit chain
  expect Postgres semantics for indexed lookups.
- **Container runs as non-root uid 65532** with read-only root
  filesystem and dropped capabilities. Operators with custom
  init-containers writing to `/` must mount tmpfs/emptyDir.

### ✨ Added — Epic #26 phases

- **P0 — Container hygiene**: Chainguard distroless base
  (digest-pinned), Trivy CVE scan, Syft SBOM, cosign keyless
  signing via GitHub OIDC, multi-arch (amd64+arm64) manifest
  inspection.
- **P1 — Postgres backend**: `asyncpg` driver, Alembic migrations,
  optional `APP_MIGRATIONS_AUTO_APPLY=false` for Helm Job mode,
  bank-grade privilege model (no SUPERUSER, no CREATE EXTENSION).
- **P2 — Encrypted secrets at rest**: `EncryptedString`
  `TypeDecorator` over `LargeBinary`, per-org `kms_data_keys` with
  LRU cache, 5 KMS backends (`fernet` for dev, `aws_kms`,
  `vault_transit`, `azure_kv`, `gcp_kms`), root-key rotation CLI
  (`python -m server.crypto rotate-root`), forward-only column
  migration with KMS-aware backfill.
- **P3 — OIDC SSO**: `authlib`-based Authorization Code + PKCE +
  state + nonce, JIT user/`OrganizationMember` provisioning with
  claim-mapped roles (`APP_OIDC_GROUP_TO_ROLE`), 15-minute access
  TTL + 8-hour refresh, IdP-validated refresh path with userinfo
  caching, logout redirect to IdP `end_session_endpoint`. Presets
  for Keycloak, Okta, Azure AD.
- **P4 — Helm chart**: `charts/tfactory/` with PSS-restricted
  security contexts, default-deny NetworkPolicy + 443 egress
  allowlist, ExternalSecret templates for 4 backends, optional
  bundled Postgres `StatefulSet` for POC mode, `customCABundle`
  for TLS-intercepting corporate proxies, schema-validated
  `values.yaml`.
- **P5 — Audit hardening**: SHA-256 hash chain on every audit-log
  write, NDJSON + CSV streaming export at `/api/audit/export`,
  air-gappable external verifier (`python -m server.audit
  verify-chain`), GDPR Art. 17 erasure that re-hashes the chain so
  `verify-chain` continues to pass, daily retention job (default
  13 months = SOC 2 12 + buffer).
- **P6 — Observability**: `structlog` JSON-to-stdout with
  ISO-8601 timestamps + `request_id` binding, correlation-ID
  middleware (`X-Request-ID`) with `httpx` propagation, Prometheus
  `/metrics` with cardinality-capped `handler` labels (route
  templates, not raw paths), optional `METRICS_SCRAPE_TOKEN`
  bearer gate, Helm `ServiceMonitor` template, pre-built Grafana
  dashboard JSON (7 panels).
- **P7 — Evidence + ship-readiness drills**: SOC 2 evidence pack
  (CC1-CC9 + A1 + C1), GDPR DPIA + data-flow diagram, STRIDE
  threat model, 4-cloud-path deployment runbook (EKS+RDS / AKS+
  Azure Postgres / GKE+Cloud SQL / vanilla K8s+Vault), v0.x → v3.0
  upgrade guide, three executable drill scripts
  (`backup-restore.sh`, `upgrade-in-place.sh`, `image-mirroring.sh`)
  with `--dry-run` modes.

`secrets (P2)`, `oidc (P3)`, `helm (P4)`, `audit (P5)`, `obs (P6)`,
`evidence (P7)`, `frontend (typecheck)`.

### ⚠ Documented v3.0 limitations (v3.1 follow-ups)

Tracked in `guides/compliance/soc2-evidence.md § Documented
limitations`. Each maps to a v3.1 Epic #35 issue:

1. Audit chain has no signed external anchor.
2. Revocation latency bounded by 15-minute access-token TTL (back-
   channel logout deferred).
3. FIPS 140-2/3 modules not validated.
4. No built-in OpenTelemetry distributed tracing.
5. Single-replica only (multi-replica via Redis pub/sub deferred).
6. LLM-call audit deferred to v3.1 LiteLLM gateway.

### ✨ Added
- **GitHub PR Review Integration**: End-to-end support for PR reviews including listing, fetching, posting reviews, checking new commits, and viewing logs via dedicated API endpoints.
- **PR Review WebSocket Events**: Real-time progress, completion, and error events via WebSocket for live feedback during PR reviews.
- **PR Action Endpoints**: Support for posting reviews, commenting, merging, assigning, and canceling PRs through backend API.
- **AI-Powered Conflict Resolution**: Enhanced "Fix Conflicts with AI" functionality with real git merge and AI resolution of conflict markers.
- **Task from Chat Feature**: Button in Insights chat to convert conversation into a structured task (title + PRD description) with editable preview.
- **Open in Browser**: New "Open in Browser" button in EditorPage that serves files with correct MIME types and asset URL rewriting.
- **QA Fixer Phase**: Added separate `qa_fixer` phase in phase configuration, allowing independent model and thinking settings.
- **Phase-Scaled Progress**: Monotonically increasing progress percentages across phases (planning 0–20%, coding 20–80%, QA 80–95%, complete 95–100%).
- **Terminal Persistence**: TerminalGrid now remains mounted across view switches to prevent stuck terminals and lost PTY connections.
- **Model & Token Metrics**: Display assistant model name on chat messages and show tokens/sec metrics after each response across all providers.
- **Dark Theme & UI Improvements**: Enhanced folder navigation, keyboard support (Enter/Backspace), HTML preview, progress labels, and overall dark theme consistency.

### 🛠️ Fixed
- **GitHub PR Connection Detection**: Fixed incorrect endpoint call (`window.API.github.checkGitHubConnection` → `window.API.checkGitHubConnection`).
- **AI Merge Conflict Resolution**: Fixed syntax error in `github.py` caused by AI-generated extra closing brace.
- **requireReviewBeforeCoding Sync**: Ensured field is written to `task_metadata.json` when editing tasks.
- **Email Notifications**: Fixed silent failure under legacy token auth by populating default user context.
- **Build Progress & Subtask Status**: Added fallback in `post_session_processing` to detect new commits and force-update status.
- **File Serving 404s**: Resolved `404` errors for `/api/files/serve` by properly staging the endpoint and enabling public access with path-traversal protection.
- **Model Config Loss**: Fixed `UpdateModelConfigRequest` to preserve all fields (provider, profileId, model, thinkingLevel, temperature).
- **Issue-to-Task Creation**: Fixed backend `TaskMetadata` model to include `githubIssueNumber`, `affectedFiles`, and `acceptanceCriteria`.
- **Sidebar Layout**: Restored proper layout and spacing in sidebar components.

### 🔧 Changed
- **Project Renaming**: Renamed from "Claude Code Manager Web" to **TFactory** across UI, navigation, and documentation.
- **MCP Template Filtering**: Removed redundant and duplicate quick templates (filesystem, fetch, github, gitlab) that conflict with native tools.
- **Hardcoded Model Values**: Replaced inline model/thinking defaults with shared constants to ensure user-configured settings take effect.
- **Git Ignore Safety**: Added `.tfactory-security.json` and `.tfactory-status` to `.gitignore` during project init and unstage during merges.
- **CLI Detection Optimization**: Improved speed using `shutil.which` and `npm package.json` parsing instead of slow Node.js startup (~4s → <50ms).

### 📦 Updated
- **README.md**: Updated project documentation with fixed GitHub URL, removed non-existent files, and added Docker deployment guide.
- **Phase Progress Logic**: Refactored progress logic to prevent backward jumps between phases using defined phase ranges.
