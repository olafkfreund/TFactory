"""The workspace lock files must not be world-readable (CodeQL py/overly-permissive-file).

`MergeLock` and `SpecNumberLock` both create their lock file with `os.open(...,
O_CREAT | O_EXCL, mode)`. The mode used to be 0o644, which publishes the holder's
PID to every other local user sharing the workspace root. These assert the mode
is owner-only, so a future edit that widens it again fails here rather than in a
scan weeks later.
