"""v3.0.1 regression — P2.3 encrypt_credentials migration works on SQLite.

v3.0.0 had a bug: the migration's "Step 5: re-apply NOT NULL" path
used `op.alter_column(... nullable=False)` directly, which SQLite
rejects (`ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET NOT NULL` is not
SQLite syntax). The fix wraps that step in `op.batch_alter_table`
so SQLite's table-copy semantics take effect.

This test runs `alembic upgrade head` against a fresh in-process
SQLite file and asserts every migration applies successfully. It
runs unconditionally (no Postgres needed) so the regression can't
silently regress on a Postgres-only CI matrix.
