"""No module may be shadowed by a same-named package beside it (#999).

When `foo.py` and `foo/` sit in the same directory, Python resolves the PACKAGE
and ignores the module. Two things follow, and both were true in this repo:

* The module is unreachable. Five files here documented themselves as facades
  "so existing imports continue to work" and none of them could ever run; each
  body (`from .command_registry import ...`, `from security import *`, ...)
  would have imported the package that shadows it if it ever had.

* Static tooling cannot see past it. A whole-package mypy measurement over
  apps/backend exited 2 having checked NOTHING:

      core/workspace/__init__.py: error: Duplicate module named "core.workspace"
        (also at "core/workspace.py")
      Found 1 error in 1 file (errors prevented further checking)

  "mypy exits 2 having checked nothing" is the shape of defect that keeps a gate
  dark without anyone noticing. The per-file ratchet is unaffected (it checks one
  file at a time), so nothing was ungated — but every whole-package sweep,
  report or measurement was blocked.

The allowlist below only ever shrinks. Adding to it is how #999 happens again.
