"""``log_audit_event`` must keep both of its promises on the failure path.

Two defects, one function, both on the path that fires when the audit row
could NOT be written -- i.e. exactly when a reader is least able to spot a
problem from the log itself.

Finding A -- log injection. ``resource_id`` is deliberately free-form
``String(255)``: a pointer into whichever table ``resource_type`` names. A
caller-controlled id carrying a newline plus a plausible timestamp forges a
whole log line the SIEM reads as real. ``log_audit_event_bg``, a few lines
below in the same module, already routes all three through ``sanitize_log``;
the sibling did not.

Finding B -- a swallowed failure that is not actually swallowed. ``db.add`` +
``db.flush`` sat directly inside the try, so a violated FK left the CALLER's
``AsyncSession`` in a needs-rollback state and the route's next ``commit()``
raised ``PendingRollbackError``. The docstring promises audit failures never
propagate; before the savepoint they propagated as a 500 on the business
request.

Both tests assert on the OBSERVABLE consequence, not on a helper's return
value: Finding A reads the LOG FILE and counts lines (a record that still
writes two lines passes any assertion made against a sanitised string), and
Finding B commits the caller's own row and reads it back.
