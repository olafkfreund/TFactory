"""Any image that upgrades packages must be able to re-run that upgrade.

CFactory#440 hit this twice, one level apart:

1. The backend image ran `apt-get upgrade`, but every workflow built it with
   `cache-from`, so the layer was served from cache and never re-ran. The
   upgrade was real; its result was frozen at whatever the distro shipped the
   day the layer was first built. Trivy failed on CVE-2026-14456 (openssl).
2. Fixing that left the FRONTEND image still failing -- it had no upgrade
   layer at all. A guard that only looked at the root Dockerfile could not see
   it.

So the rule is per-build, not per-repo: follow each cached build step to the
Dockerfile it names, and if that Dockerfile upgrades packages, require the
cache-bust arg on both sides. Images with no upgrade layer are out of scope
here (a separate policy question) rather than silently passing as "fine".
