"""WIQL injection via the tenant-supplied ADO project name (Factory#721).

The provider layer under ``runners/github/`` is vendored byte-exact from the
Factory hub canonical and policed by ``factory-github-drift.yml``. The escaping
fix and its full test live there. This test is the BEHAVIOURAL half of the
propagation check: the drift gate proves the bytes arrived, and this proves the
bytes that arrived actually do the thing -- a gate comparing a service copy to
a canonical would stay green if the canonical itself regressed.

The assertion is not "the output contains two quotes"; an off-by-one doubling
contains two quotes as well. The remainder of the WHERE clause after the project
literal must be byte-identical to the remainder produced by a benign project
name: the tenant may fill the literal and may contribute nothing to the query's
structure.
