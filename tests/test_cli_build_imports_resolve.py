"""Every name the build/followup CLI imports must actually be importable.

TFactory#1114: `cli/build_commands.py` imported `run_autonomous_agent` from
`agent`, and no such name exists anywhere in the tree -- the fork removed the
coder agent and never pruned the CLI. The import sat as the FIRST statement of
`handle_build_command`, so every build the cockpit started died there:

    ImportError: cannot import name 'run_autonomous_agent' from 'agent'

reproduced against the deployed pod, not just a checkout.

It stayed invisible because nothing asserted that a lazily-imported name
resolves. A module-level `import` would have been caught by any test that
imports the module; a function-local one is only caught by running the
function, and the only test that did (`tests/test_refactoring.py`) sits outside
every path CI collects (Factory#844).

So this asserts the property directly -- the names, not the behaviour -- which
is cheap, needs no Claude SDK client, and fails the moment a lazy import names
something that is not there.
