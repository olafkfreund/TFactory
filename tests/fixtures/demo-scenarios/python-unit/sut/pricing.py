"""Pricing helpers for the TFactory `python-unit` demo SUT.

A small, *finished* feature a developer hands to TFactory to prove the maths is
covered, stable, and mutation-resistant before merge. The module is correct;
the demo's teaching moment is that a naive generated test for ``bulk_total``'s
rounding under-asserts, so the Evaluator's mutate-and-check signal surfaces a
SURVIVED mutant and the Triager returns a ``flag`` verdict.
