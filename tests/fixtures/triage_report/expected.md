## Committed

- **`ac1-login-expiry`** — `tests/test_ac1-login-expiry.py`
  - signals: coverage +7.50%, stability=stable, mutation=killed, semantic=high
  - reason: coverage +7.5%; mutation killed; semantic relevance high

## Flagged

- **`ac2-store-mut`** — `tests/test_ac2-store-mut.py`
  - signals: coverage +1.20%, stability=stable, mutation=no_mutation, semantic=medium
  - reason: mutation probe found nothing to mutate
  - reason: shallow assertion

## Rejected

- **`ac3-naive-true`** — `tests/test_ac3-naive-true.py`
  - signals: coverage +0.00%, stability=stable, mutation=survived, semantic=low
  - reason: mutation survived — assertion is tautological

## Dedup Collisions

- **whitespace_normalised**: kept `ac1-login-expiry`, dropped `ac1-login-expiry-dup`
