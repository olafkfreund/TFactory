"""
Subprocess environment helper.

TFactory is OAuth-only by design — the Claude Agent SDK should never see
``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` because that would silently bill against the user's
direct API account instead of their Claude Code subscription
(see ``apps/backend/core/auth.py`` for the canonical policy comment).

Every place TFactory spawns a subprocess that may run a Claude CLI / SDK
call must build its env via ``make_subprocess_env()`` instead of bare
``os.environ.copy()``. The user's interactive PTY shell is the deliberate
exception — that's their own shell, they expect their normal env.
