"""Auth + scope gating for the stdio-MCP proxy (Issue #154).

Routes under ``/api/mcp-stdio/`` accept two kinds of bearer tokens:

1. **acw_ API keys** minted via ``routes/api_keys.py`` — validated
   against the ``ApiKey`` table, hashed at rest, scope-gated. This is
   the recommended path for enterprise installs: each developer holds
   a scoped key, no shared host-wide secret.

2. **Legacy admin token** (``settings.API_TOKEN`` — usually backed by
   ``~/.tfactory/.token``) — acts as a wildcard "all scopes" key.
   This preserves v1.0 behavior so single-user laptops keep working
   without minting a key.

Scopes are the same vocabulary used by ``mcp_remote`` plus a few
finer-grained ones for write operations:

- ``mcp:read``     — read tools (list/status/logs)
- ``project:write`` — create projects
- ``task:write``    — start, stop, recover, approve, create-and-run tasks
- ``task:merge``    — create-pr, merge-pr (default-branch blast radius)

Use ``require_acw_scope(scope)`` as a FastAPI dependency on each
proxy route. It returns the resolved ``AuthenticatedKey`` (or a
synthetic legacy key) so handlers can record key_id in audit logs.
