"""OpenTelemetry tracing — OTLP export to the fleet's collector (Factory#516).

A PARR run crosses PFactory -> AIFactory -> TFactory and is displayed by
CFactory. Only AIFactory ever exported a span; this service had no
``OTEL_*`` configuration at all, so it logged no export failure and its
silence read as health. A trace could never span a handoff, which is the
one question distributed tracing exists to answer.

## Off by default, and honest when on

``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`` unset (the default outside the cluster,
and in every test run) means no exporter is installed: spans still get
created by the FastAPI instrumentation, cost nothing, and are dropped.

When the endpoint IS set, the exporter is installed AND PROVEN before
this module claims anything. Constructing an ``OTLPSpanExporter`` touches
no network, so "tracing enabled" logged straight after that constructor
describes configuration, not delivery — and in AIFactory it described
delivery that had never once happened: every batch came back 401 for the
entire life of the fleet because the exporter sent ``Authorization:
Bearer`` and OpenObserve v0.90.3 answers Bearer with ``401 Not
Supported``. It authenticates OTLP ingest with HTTP Basic and nothing
else.

So ``init_tracing()`` spends one empty OTLP POST first. ``export([])``
round-trips the auth header without carrying any span data, which
separates "configured" from "accepted":

    accepted    -> INFO    "OTel tracing enabled ... (startup export accepted)"
    rejected    -> ERROR   "... REJECTED the startup export: NO SPANS WILL LAND"
    unprobeable -> WARNING "... enabled but UNVERIFIED"

The exporter is installed in all three cases: a collector that is merely
restarting must be able to recover without a pod bounce, so a failed
probe downgrades the claim, never the wiring. The error names the auth
*scheme* and never its value — the scheme was the whole diagnosis, and it
leaks nothing.

## Noise

A persistently rejected exporter emits an identical ERROR every export
interval — in AIFactory, 199 of the last 300 log lines. A log that has to
be read through ``grep -v otlp`` is how a real error gets missed. The SDK
exporter's own logger is rate-limited to one line per
``OTEL_EXPORT_ERROR_INTERVAL`` seconds (default 300) plus a
suppressed-count summary on the next line through.

## The app that is instrumented must be the app that serves

Everything above was already true and this service still exported ZERO
spans for its entire life, while logging both "startup export accepted"
and "instrumentation installed: FastAPI". The entry point is
``python -m server.main``, which builds the application TWICE in one
process:

    python -m server.main
      -> imports server/main.py as module `__main__`
         -> app = create_app()            # app A, init_tracing(A) runs
      -> uvicorn.run("server.main:app")
         -> imports server/main.py AGAIN, as module `server.main`
            -> app = create_app()         # app B, init_tracing(B) runs
      -> uvicorn serves app B

Both apps are real; only B ever sees a request. ``init_tracing`` returned
early on the second call because a single ``_initialized`` flag covered
the process-wide half (provider, exporter, httpx) AND the per-app half
(FastAPI middleware) — so app B was never instrumented and no server span
was ever created. The pod log proves it: the "Stdio MCP proxy mounted"
line appears twice, once under logger ``__main__`` and once under
``server.main``, with the tracing lines only after the first.

The flag now covers the process-wide half only. Instrumentation runs for
every app handed in, which is correct however many times the module is
imported. Refs Factory#516.

## What is instrumented

FastAPI (server spans, and W3C ``traceparent`` EXTRACTION from inbound
requests) and httpx (client spans, and ``traceparent`` INJECTION into
outbound ones). Those two are what make a trace cross a service boundary;
the cross-factory calls in this fleet are httpx calls into another
factory's FastAPI. Database and cache instrumentation is deliberately not
included — it adds span volume without adding a handoff.
