"""Capability discovery endpoint.

The frontend hits this once on mount to know which optional features
are turned on for this server, so it can render the right UI without
404-probing every endpoint.  Added in Epic #44 R2 specifically so the
Live Console tab can hide itself when ``TFACTORY_RMUX_ENABLED`` is
unset — but the endpoint is intentionally extensible (it just returns
a flat dict the frontend can consult).

Always mounted.  Returning an extra boolean costs nothing; teaching
the bank-pilot frontend to politely 404 because rmux is off would be
worse.
