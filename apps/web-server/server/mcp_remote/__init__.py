"""Remote HTTP+SSE MCP server (Epic #50 / Issue #83).

Sister of the stdio MCP server at ``apps/backend/mcp_server/tfactory_server.py``.
Same control-plane surface (list/get/start/stop tasks), different transport
(HTTP+SSE instead of stdio) so non-Claude MCP clients — Cursor, Continue.dev,
custom scripts, Claude Code running on a different host making programmatic
calls — can observe and direct TFactory regardless of which LLM is doing the
work underneath.

Opt-in only. Set ``TFACTORY_MCP_REMOTE_ENABLED=true`` to mount; default off
to keep the v1.0 pilot's attack surface minimal.

Auth model
----------

The MCP server uses the existing ``acw_<urlsafe32>`` API keys from
``apps/web-server/server/routes/api_keys.py``. Two NEW scopes are required:

  * ``mcp:read``   — for list/get/diff/status tools
  * ``mcp:write``  — for start/stop/approve/reject/merge tools

The middleware-style ``TokenAuthMiddleware`` validates JWT + the legacy
``settings.API_TOKEN``; it does NOT validate ``acw_`` keys today. Per
issue #83 we add a thin auth adapter here that does ``acw_`` key
validation directly against the DB — same DB schema, no migration.

Hosting
-------

Embedded in the existing FastAPI app. Two routes:

  * ``GET  /api/mcp/sse``      — SSE event stream the client subscribes to
  * ``POST /api/mcp/messages/`` — client-to-server JSON-RPC frames

Both honour the ``Authorization: Bearer acw_<key>`` header.
