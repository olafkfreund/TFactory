"""Auth adapter for the Remote HTTP+SSE MCP server.

``TokenAuthMiddleware`` (the web-server's main bearer-token gate) validates
JWTs + the legacy ``settings.API_TOKEN``. It does NOT validate the
``acw_<urlsafe32>`` API keys minted via ``routes/api_keys.py``.

Per issue #83's design, the MCP control plane uses ``acw_`` keys — not the
admin-grade legacy token — so it can be scope-gated (``mcp:read`` /
``mcp:write``). This module bridges that gap with a thin DB-backed
validator.

Why not extend ``TokenAuthMiddleware`` instead?
- The legacy middleware sees every API route, including non-MCP ones. We
  don't want a key with only ``mcp:read`` to be able to GET ``/api/tasks``
  on the regular REST surface — that's the legacy bearer's job.
- Keeping the scope check local to the MCP module means the regular REST
  middleware stays exactly as-is; nothing about the v1.0 pilot's auth
  posture changes.
