"""Client-safe error reporting: a correlation id to the caller, the detail to the log.

CWE-209 / ``py/stack-trace-exposure``. Handlers across this server did:

    except Exception as e:
        return {"success": False, "error": str(e)}

and that string is a response body. It is written by third-party libraries and by
the stdlib, and it routinely names internal detail the caller has no business
seeing: an absolute path on disk, an internal hostname and port from a
connection failure, which environment variables are unset, the exception class of
whatever library actually broke. Several of these routes are reachable before the
caller has any project scope at all.

Truncating does not help -- the leak is at the FRONT of the string.

So the detail goes to the server log under a fresh correlation id, and the caller
gets a generic sentence plus that id:

    to the caller:  "Failed to create the pull request (reference 9f2c1ab04d3e)"

    to the log:     WARNING server.routes.pr Failed to create the pull request
                    [ref=9f2c1ab04d3e]: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file
                    or directory: '/etc/tfactory/gh.pem'
                    Traceback (most recent call last): ...

Support can still answer "what actually happened", the caller can still quote
something specific, and nothing internal crosses the boundary. This is the shape
CFactory#372 landed for the same alert class; keep the two the same.

# A guard in the hub that can only raise `ValueError` forces every consumer
# wanting the marked behaviour to keep a fork of the guard, which is exactly the

# `client_message` attribute and its `ValueError` base, so this is a move rather
# than a behaviour change; the full rationale is in
