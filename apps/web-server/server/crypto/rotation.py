"""KMS root-key rotation for TFactory's encrypted-at-rest secrets.

Rotation re-wraps every per-org data key under a *new* KMS root reference.
The plaintext data keys themselves don't change — so the millions of
EncryptedString-protected columns don't need to be touched. Only the
``kms_data_keys.wrapped_key`` blobs are updated.

This module is the implementation of the rotation runbook (P2.6).
Operators trigger it via::

    python -m server.crypto rotate-root \\
        --new-kms-key-id <id-of-new-CMK-or-Vault-key>

…with the new backend's credentials wired in the env (e.g. for AWS:
``AWS_KMS_KEY_ID_NEW`` plus the new CMK's IAM permissions for the
running identity). The CLI's job is to build OLD and NEW backend
instances from env and call ``rotate_root()``.

The rotation window is the period during which BOTH the old and new
KMS root keys are usable. Operators must:
  1. Provision the new root, grant the running identity Encrypt+Decrypt
     on it.
  2. Keep the old root's Decrypt permission alive.
  3. Run the rotation.
  4. After confirming success, revoke the old root (or schedule its
     deletion per the cloud provider's grace period — AWS = 7-30 days,
     Vault = manual archive).

Crash safety: each row is rotated in its own transaction. A mid-run
crash leaves some rows under OLD and some under NEW — BOTH backends
must remain usable until the rotation completes. The function is safe
to re-run; rows already rotated past the run-start timestamp are
skipped on a re-run.

Backend-agnostic: the function takes two ``Backend`` instances and
treats them as opaque ``encrypt`` / ``decrypt`` pairs. Works for all
five backend types (fernet, aws_kms, vault_transit, azure_kv, gcp_kms)
without per-backend code paths.
