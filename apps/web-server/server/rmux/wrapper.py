"""Async subprocess wrapper around the ``rmux`` CLI.

Epic #44 / issue #45 (R0b).

Every later piece of the rmux integration (``session.py``, ``bridge.py``,
``agent_service`` hook) depends on this module.  It is deliberately the
thinnest layer that maps Python coroutines to ``rmux <subcommand>``
invocations, with three structured error classes so callers can branch
on *why* a call failed instead of parsing stderr text in five places.

Design notes
------------

**Socket directory.**  rmux refuses to start with a socket in a directory
it does not own (the v0.3.0 startup check rejects ``/tmp`` with
``i/o error: rmux startup refused '/tmp': owned by uid 0 but expected
uid <N>``).  We default the socket to a user-owned path:

  1. ``$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/tfactory-rmux/sock`` if the env var is set
     (standard on systemd user sessions; ``/run/user/<uid>/`` is owned
     by the user and tmpfs-backed)
  2. ``~/.cache/tfactory/rmux/sock`` as a portable fallback

Operators can override with the ``socket_dir`` constructor arg — the
production container uses ``/var/run/tfactory/rmux/`` via an
``emptyDir`` volume (see design §3.4).

**Daemon lifecycle.**  rmux auto-starts a server on first session
command, so ``ensure_daemon`` is really a "verify the binary exists,
mkdir the socket dir, smoke-test reachability" call rather than an
explicit fork.  It is idempotent and cheap.

**Error classification.**  rmux's stderr is reasonably stable but not
machine-parseable.  We match on substrings ("no server", "can't find
session") and raise typed exceptions.  Anything we don't recognise
becomes a plain ``RmuxError`` — the caller can still log it.

**Concurrency.**  Every public method is a coroutine.  We never share
subprocess state between calls, so concurrent invocations from
different ``asyncio.Task``s are safe.  The shared socket file is
serialised by the rmux server itself.
