"""WebSocket bridge between rmux pane FIFOs and browser xterm.js (Epic #44).

Two endpoints, both gated by ``TFACTORY_RMUX_ENABLED``:

  GET  /api/tasks/{task_id}/agent-console/ws       (WebSocket)
       Streams pane bytes FIFO→browser.  In attach mode, also accepts
       browser keystrokes and forwards via ``rmux send-keys``.

  POST /api/tasks/{task_id}/agent-console/attach   (JSON)
       Body: ``{"connection_id": "..."}``.  Flips the named WS
       connection into bidirectional mode AND writes an
       ``audit.action=console.attach`` row.  At most one attached
       connection per session — concurrent POSTs lose to 409 Conflict.

The race-safe attach contract (design §3.1):

  1. WS server generates ``connection_id`` (UUID v4) on accept, sends
     it as the first ``{"type":"connected","connection_id":...}`` frame
  2. ``POST /attach`` acquires the per-session ``asyncio.Lock``
  3. If ``state.attached_connection_id is None``: set it to the
     request body's connection_id, write audit row, release lock,
     return 200
  4. Else: release lock, return 409 Conflict
  5. WS receive loop polls ``state.attached_connection_id == self.cid``
     to decide whether to forward inbound bytes
  6. On WS disconnect or ``POST /detach``: clear under the same lock,
     write ``console.detach`` audit row

Browser→pane byte encoding: xterm.js sends raw key bytes (e.g. ``\\x1b[A``
for up-arrow, ``\\x03`` for Ctrl-C, plain UTF-8 for printable text).
We forward via ``send_keys`` (no ``-l``) so rmux interprets control
sequences correctly.
