"""Tiny shim between ``agent_service`` and the rmux session/bridge layer.

Keeps the integration footprint in ``agent_service.py`` minimal — one
import, three callsites (create, stop-reap, monitor-reap) — and
centralises the ``TFACTORY_RMUX_ENABLED`` flag check + the worktree
path convention.

When the flag is unset or false:
  - ``create_if_enabled`` returns ``None`` and does nothing
  - ``reap_if_enabled`` is a no-op
  - existing behaviour is byte-for-byte unchanged
