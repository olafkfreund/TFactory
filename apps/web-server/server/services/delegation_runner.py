"""Run the Copilot delegation flow for a prepared spec.

Shared by ``auto_fix_service.start_auto_fix`` and the wizard task-start
route (``routes/execution.py::start_task``). Both paths converge here so
there's exactly one place that knows how to:

1. Spawn the planner-only subprocess.
2. **Await** that subprocess to completion (gap #3 from issue #144 — the
   original V1-B inline path returned immediately after spawn, which meant
   the enrichment comment was rendered before ``test_plan.json``
   was written).
3. Render the TFactory enrichment comment.
4. Skip if a previous run already posted an enrichment comment on the same
   issue (bonus dedupe from #144).
5. Post the comment + assign Copilot.
6. Persist the queue/task state + emit a ``task:status`` event.

Caller is responsible for having already verified that the project's
``gitProvider == "github"`` and that the task wants delegation. This
helper does not gate on either — it assumes the policy decision is done.
