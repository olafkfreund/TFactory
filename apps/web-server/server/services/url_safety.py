"""One SSRF guard for outbound URLs the web-server fetches on a caller's behalf.

This module is a verbatim port of AIFactory's
``apps/web-server/server/services/url_safety.py``. It is deliberately the same
file at the same path in both repos: the alternative is each service growing its
own dialect of "is this URL safe", which is how the fourth caller ends up
unguarded. If this needs to change, change it in the fleet, not here alone.

Before this module TFactory had one partial check (``routes/git.py``'s
``_safe_ollama_base_url``, which compared the hostname against two literal
strings) and nothing at all on the LLM-provider probe routes, which take a URL
straight from a request body or query string and fetch it server-side.

Two postures, because the fleet genuinely needs both:

``allow_private=False`` (default) -- the strict posture. The host must resolve to
a PUBLIC address. Use it wherever the URL is attacker-supplied and there is no
legitimate reason to reach inside the network -- a cloud API base URL, for
instance.

``allow_private=True`` -- for endpoints whose whole purpose is to reach an
operator-configured service on the local network: a self-hosted Ollama at
``http://localhost:11434``, an OpenAI-compatible server on a cluster-internal
address. Here blocking RFC-1918 would break the product, so this posture keeps
the guards that cost nothing legitimate -- an http(s)-only scheme, and a hard
block on the cloud metadata addresses, which are never a real Ollama and are the
single highest-value SSRF target.

What neither posture fixes: DNS rebinding. The host is resolved here and
re-resolved by the transport at connect time, so a hostile DNS server can answer
differently the second time. Closing it needs IP-pinning at the socket layer.
Recorded rather than implied.
