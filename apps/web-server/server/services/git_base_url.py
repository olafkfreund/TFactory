"""One SSRF check for the per-project ``gitBaseUrl`` setting (#1110).

Its own module, rather than a private helper in ``routes/github.py``, because
both readers of the setting need it and the repo's strict bar bans the relative
and function-local imports that sharing it across those two packages would
otherwise need (TID252 / PLC0415). A leaf module they can both import at the top
also keeps ``auto_fix_service`` from importing a routes module for one function.

This adds no SSRF logic: it calls ``url_safety.assert_safe_outbound_url``, the
guard every live web-server call site already uses (cf. #1111, which is about
not growing a second dialect of this check).

    """SSRF-check the per-project ``gitBaseUrl`` before a credential rides on it (#1110).

    ``gitBaseUrl`` is stored per project and settable through
    ``PATCH /api/projects/{id}/settings``, a route with no ``Depends`` of its own:
    ``TokenAuthMiddleware`` admits any JWT access token, the legacy ``API_TOKEN``
    or an ``api:full`` API key, and there is no role or ownership check beyond
    that. The stored value becomes the provider's ``_base_url``, and every
    provider attaches a real credential to the requests it addresses -- a GitLab
    ``PRIVATE-TOKEN``, a Duo ``Authorization: Bearer``, an Azure DevOps
    Basic-auth PAT, a GitHub bearer token. So a non-operator can steer a
    credentialed outbound request.

    The check sits here, where the untrusted value is read, and not inside
    ``runners/github/providers/factory.py``: that file is the vendored
    factory-github canonical shared byte-for-byte with PFactory, AIFactory and
    CFactory, none of which feed it a stored URL. Guarding at TFactory's own
    trust boundary keeps the canonical undrifted and puts the check next to the
    input it distrusts.

    ``allow_private=True``: a self-hosted GitLab CE/EE or Azure DevOps Server on
    a LAN is a legitimate target, so refusing RFC-1918 would break real
    deployments. Both postures still refuse the cloud-metadata range, which is
    the one with no legitimate use and a credential-harvesting payoff.

    Returns the checked URL, so the caller is forced to use the value the check
    actually saw rather than re-reading the setting.
