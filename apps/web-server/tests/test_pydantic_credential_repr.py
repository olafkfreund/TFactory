"""Guard: no credential-bearing pydantic field may render its secret.

Factory#377, the pydantic half of Factory#372. Request models across
``server/routes`` declared their secret as a plain ``str``, so pydantic rendered
it verbatim on every surface::

    >>> repr(CreateGitCredentialRequest(token="glpat-SUPERSECRET123", ...))
    "CreateGitCredentialRequest(..., token='glpat-SUPERSECRET123', ...)"

A FastAPI request model is not a debug-only surface: it is the object bound to a
local in the traceback frame when the handler's downstream call raises, so an
unhandled exception writes the credential into the log, the error sink and any
crash reporter attached to them. The irony was sharpest in
``routes/git_credentials.py``, where the field's own ``description`` reads "The
Personal Access Token. Never logged, encrypted at rest" -- untrue for as long as
the model was reprable.

Two guards, mirroring ``tests/test_provider_credential_repr.py`` in the hub:

* :func:`test_no_credential_field_renders_its_secret` is the generic one. It
  parses every module under the web server and the two credential-handling
  backend packages with :mod:`ast` -- no imports, no third-party dependency --
  and fails any credential-named field on a ``BaseModel``/``BaseSettings`` that
  is neither ``SecretStr`` nor ``repr=False``. A model added next month is
  covered without anyone remembering this file exists. Pinning today's models by
  name would pass forever while the next ``token: str`` sailed in.
* The behavioural tests below construct the real models with a fake secret and
  prove it is absent from ``repr()``, ``str()`` and ``model_dump()`` -- and that
  the true value still reaches the point of use. A credential masked everywhere
  including where it is needed is a broken feature, not a secure one.

WHICH FIX APPLIES WHERE
    ``SecretStr`` is preferred, and is what the inbound request models use: it
    masks ``repr()``, ``str()``, ``model_dump()`` and ``model_dump_json()``
    alike, where ``repr=False`` masks only the first two and still leaks through
    a ``model_dump()`` that lands in a log line.

    ``repr=False`` is used only where ``SecretStr`` would break the feature, and
    each case is a real one here rather than a matter of taste:

    * ``AppSettings`` / ``SettingsUpdate`` / ``ClaudeProfile`` /
      ``ApiProfileUpdate`` / ``SourceEnvUpdate`` / ``ProjectEnvUpdate`` /
      ``ProjectSettings*`` / ``AutoFixConfigPayload`` are PERSISTED by dumping
      them -- ``save_app_settings`` writes ``model_dump_json()`` straight to
      disk. Under ``SecretStr`` the first save would overwrite every stored
      credential with ``"**********"``: silent, permanent credential loss.
    * ``AuthResponse`` / ``TokenResponse`` / ``RefreshResponse`` are RESPONSE
      models. The token has to reach the browser as JSON, and ``SecretStr``
      would serialise a mask, breaking login outright.
    * ``config.Settings`` interpolates its tokens directly
      (``f"Bearer {settings.API_TOKEN}"``), which under ``SecretStr`` still
      compiles while silently sending ``Bearer **********``.
