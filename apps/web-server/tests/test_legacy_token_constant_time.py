"""The legacy API_TOKEN comparison must be constant-time and never match empty.

Both assertions matter, and the second is the one with teeth:

1. A correct token still authenticates — the fix must not break the legacy path.
2. An EMPTY configured token must never authenticate. This is what discriminates
   the fix from the bug: `hmac.compare_digest` guarded by `if not configured`
   returns False, whereas the previous `token == settings.API_TOKEN` makes
   `"" == ""` TRUE and authenticates an empty token as the shared secret.

Timing itself is not asserted — a wall-clock timing test is flaky in CI and
proves little on a shared runner. The guard is that the code path uses
compare_digest and rejects empties; assertion 2 fails the moment someone
reverts to `==`.
