"""CWE-209 on the insights providers (#1068, batch 1).

Every provider ended its ``except`` handler with:

    await broadcast_event("insights:chunk", {..., "error": str(e)})

``broadcast_event`` is not a response body — it is worse. It pushes the payload
over the WebSocket to every client subscribed to that project, so a connection
failure naming an internal host and port, or an ``OSError`` naming a path on
our disk, was fanned out rather than returned to the one caller who caused it.

These assert on the **broadcast payload**, which is the thing that actually
crosses the boundary, and they drive the providers through their real failure
seams: ``httpx.AsyncClient`` for the HTTP providers, and
``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`` for the CLI ones.

Mutation check: make ``server.error_ref.error_reference`` return ``str(exc)``
and every case below goes red naming the fragment that escaped.
