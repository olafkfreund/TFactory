"""An in-process migration must not take over the app's logging (#923).

`alembic.ini` carries `[logger_root] level = WARN, handlers = console`, and
`env.py` called `fileConfig` unconditionally. `disable_existing_loggers=False`
stops existing loggers being *disabled*; it does not stop `fileConfig`
reconfiguring the ROOT logger. App loggers own no handler of their own
(`setup_logging` configures the root), so from the first in-process
`alembic upgrade` every app INFO record propagated to a WARN root and was
dropped -- for the life of the process, not just during the migration.

Only ERROR cleared the bar, which is what made this worth a test rather than a
one-line fix: a pod whose startup hooks ran perfectly logged *identically* to
one whose hooks never executed. That ambiguity is exactly what #918 was about,
and nothing asserted on log output after startup, so it went unnoticed for as
long as MIGRATIONS_AUTO_APPLY has defaulted true.
