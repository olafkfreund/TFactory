"""Every .husky hook must be executable in the index, or git skips it (#921).

`.husky/commit-msg` was committed 100644. Git refuses to run a non-executable
hook and says so only as a `hint:` on stderr, which is not a failure and is
easy to miss:

    hint: The '.../.husky/commit-msg' hook was ignored because it's not set as
    executable.

So the hook had never run in any clone since it was added, while `.husky/pre-commit`
(100755) ran on every commit -- meaning "the hooks passed" and "git skipped a
hook entirely" looked identical.

The mode lives in the index, so this is a property of the repo rather than of
one checkout, and a test can assert it. Same class as AIFactory#1087.
