"""A log record must not be forgeable through its own message (AIFactory#1320).

The portal serves a log viewer: ``routes/logs.py`` calls ``get_recent_logs``,
which reads the rotating log FILES and hands each line to ``parse_log_line``.
That parser used to split on ``" | "`` and trust the pieces, so the viewer's
timestamp, level and logger name came straight from the line's own text.

Any attacker-controlled string that reaches a log message could therefore
fabricate an entry: a filename, a URL, a subprocess's stderr, or an exception's
own text. The exception path was the one that could not be escaped away --
``error_reference`` sanitises the message, then passes the same exception to
``exc_info``, and the logging module renders ``str(exc)`` itself, never through
our sanitizer. So the raw text was always emitted alongside the escaped copy.

The fix is structural rather than another escape: records are written as one
JSON object per line. A newline inside a JSON string is encoded as ``\\n``, so
no field value can start a new line, and one record is one line by
construction.

These tests drive the REAL pipeline -- ``setup_logging`` writes to a temp log
dir, ``error_reference`` emits, and the assertions read the file back through
``parse_log_line``, which is exactly what the viewer does.

Mutation check: put the ``" | "`` formatter back in ``setup_logging`` and
``test_a_newline_cannot_fabricate_a_viewer_entry`` goes red with a CRITICAL
entry nobody logged.
