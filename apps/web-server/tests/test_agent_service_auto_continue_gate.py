"""`start_task_execution(auto_continue=False)` must not crash (CodeQL 1695).

The human-review gate -- `spec_dir`, `requirements_file`, `task_metadata_file`
and `require_review` -- was indented one level too deep, inside
`if auto_continue:`. Nothing about reading `task_metadata.json` to decide
whether to pass `--force` depends on auto-continue; the block just drifted
under the two-line `if` above it.

The result was a hard failure, not a subtle one. `spec_dir` is read again
outside the block, ~230 lines later::

    self._spec_dirs[task_id] = spec_dir

so every execution with `auto_continue=False` raised, AFTER the agent
subprocess had already been spawned:

    UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'spec_dir'
    where it is not associated with a value

`--force` was also never decided on that path, and `_write_skill_context` never
ran, so the task's selected skills were silently dropped too.

The alert named `spec_dir` only, because that is the one use that escapes the
block. `require_review` and `_write_skill_context(spec_dir)` sit inside it and
were invisible to the analyzer -- the fix is the dedent, not a guard on the one
flagged name.

Mutation check: re-indent lines 2840-2903 of `agent_service.py` back under
`if auto_continue:` and this test goes red with that UnboundLocalError.
