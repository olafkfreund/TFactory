"""The tracing module must not claim an export that was refused (Factory#516).

The bug this locks: "OTel tracing enabled" was logged straight after the
``OTLPSpanExporter`` constructor, which touches no network. For the whole
life of the fleet that line was true about configuration and false about
delivery — every batch came back 401. So the only thing worth testing here
is that the claim tracks the collector's answer.

Mutation-checked: make ``verify_export_auth`` ignore its result and
``test_rejected_export_*`` fail; make ``_RateLimitFilter.filter`` return
True unconditionally and ``test_rate_limit_suppresses`` fails.
