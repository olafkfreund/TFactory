"""CLI-account login: the auth event must arrive, and the token file must
never exist at readable permissions.

Two defects in ``server/routes/cli_accounts.py``:

* ``_broadcast_cli_auth_event`` ran the WebSocket broadcast on an event loop
  it created inside the polling worker thread, so the send touched
  connections owned by the ASGI server's loop. ``broadcast_event`` swallows
  send errors and unregisters the client -- a silent drop.
* ``_save_credentials`` wrote OAuth tokens with ``write_text`` and chmod'd to
  0600 afterwards, leaving the secret on disk at umask permissions in
  between (and truncating in place, so a concurrent reader sees a torn file).
  ``server/paths.py`` already had ``write_secret_file`` (#688); this
  call site was not using it.
