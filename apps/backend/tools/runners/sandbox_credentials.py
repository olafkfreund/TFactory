"""Sandbox credential injection for network-enabled lanes (#73).

Per-lane gating: the **unit** lane runs ``--network=none`` with NO credentials.
Only **network-enabled** lanes (api / integration, ``network != "none"``)
receive broker-resolved credentials, and only when **egress is explicitly
opted in** for the project. Resolved secret files (e.g. a kubeconfig) are
materialised 0600 on the host by the broker, bind-mounted **read-only** into
the container, and **wiped after the run** via :meth:`SandboxCredentials.wipe`.

This keeps the default path (unit lane, egress off) completely credential-free.
