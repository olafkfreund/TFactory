"""TFactory workspace management.

Snapshot copies of AIFactory specs live under
``~/.tfactory/workspaces/{project_id}/specs/{spec_id}/context/``.

See ``snapshotter`` for the read-only snapshot routine that lets the
TFactory pipeline operate on a frozen copy of an AIFactory spec
without ever mutating the upstream source.
