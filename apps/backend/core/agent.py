Agent Session Logic
===================

Core agent interaction functions for running autonomous coding sessions.
Uses subtask-based implementation plans with minimal, focused prompts.

Architecture:
- Orchestrator (Python) handles all bookkeeping: memory, commits, progress
- Agent focuses ONLY on implementing code
- Post-session processing updates memory automatically (100% reliable)

Enhanced with status file updates for ccstatusline integration.
Enhanced with Graphiti memory for cross-session context retrieval.

NOTE: This module is now a facade that imports from agents/ submodules.
All logic has been refactored into focused modules for better maintainability.

This fork removed the coder agent (`run_autonomous_agent`).

`run_followup_planner` was ALSO listed here as removed, and that was wrong: it
is alive at `agents/followup_planner.py:44` and imports fine. Only its
re-export through this facade went away. The stale line cost real time during
TFactory#1114 -- it reads as "the function is gone", so a wrong-module import
looks like a missing capability, and the two need opposite fixes.

so only the names `agents` actually exports are re-exported here. See
agents/__init__.py's docstring for what replaces the coder agent.
