"""Best-effort hand-back from the Triager's terminal status (#185 / #85).

When the Triager reaches a terminal status, it calls :func:`maybe_handback`,
which reads the run's failure artifacts, builds a correction request, and —
when there is something to hand back — writes the artifact and (opt-in) sends it
to AIFactory.

Two env gates, mirroring ``TFACTORY_TRIAGER_GIT_WRITE``:

  - ``TFACTORY_HANDBACK_PREPARE`` — **default ON**. Build + write the artifact.
    Set falsy to disable the hand-back entirely.
  - ``TFACTORY_HANDBACK_SEND``    — **default OFF**. Actually POST to AIFactory.

Everything here is best-effort: any failure returns ``None`` and never disturbs
the Triager's own terminal status.
