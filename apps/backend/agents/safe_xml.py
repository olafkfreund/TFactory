"""XML parsing hardened against entity-expansion denial of service.

`xml.etree.ElementTree` is documented by CPython as vulnerable to
entity-expansion attacks ("billion laughs", quadratic blowup): a few hundred
bytes of nested entity declarations expand to gigabytes during parsing and
exhaust the process. The reports this fleet parses -- Cobertura `coverage.xml`,
Playwright/JUnit `junit.xml`, JaCoCo `jacoco.xml` -- are emitted by the system
under test, which is LLM-generated or user-supplied code running inside the
verification sandbox. That input is not trusted.

The remedy is to reject entity DECLARATIONS outright. Every expansion attack
needs one, and none of the report formats above legitimately declares an
entity, so rejecting them costs nothing and closes the class. This is done at
the expat layer, where the handlers actually live: `ElementTree.XMLParser` on
CPython 3.9+ is the C accelerator and exposes no way to reach them, so the
parser is driven directly and fed into a stock `ElementTree.TreeBuilder`.

Namespace handling matches `ElementTree`'s own: expat is created with `}` as
the namespace separator and `{` is prepended, yielding the familiar
`{uri}local` tags.
