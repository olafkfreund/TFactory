"""Visual Inspection correction plan (#170 / P2 #172).

The one LLM-touched artifact: given a run's failures (error screenshots +
messages + the step it broke on), produce **recommendations + a correction plan**
that's AiFactory-task-ready — i.e. a reviewer can hand `correction-plan.md`
straight to a coding agent as the task.

The LLM is an **injectable seam** (`generate`) so tests run without an SDK, and
there is a **deterministic fallback** when no generator is wired (or it fails) —
the plan always renders. Mirrors the evaluator's LLM-with-fallback split.
