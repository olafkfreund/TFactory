"""Agent output envelope — one tolerant JSON extractor for all agents (#96).

Chat-tuned models and agentic CLIs rarely return a bare JSON document.
They wrap it in a ```json fence, prepend "Here's the plan:", append a
closing remark, or — on a dropped or rate-limited turn — return nothing
at all. Historically every TFactory agent that reads a JSON artefact out
of a model response re-implemented its own salvage path: the brace-match
fallback in ``analysis.insight_extractor`` and the ``_loads_tolerant``
helper in ``agents.evaluator`` are two slightly different solutions to the
same problem. This module is the single canonical extractor those call
sites can share.

Pure compute, stdlib-only. ``extract_json`` never returns ``None`` — it
returns ``(doc, salvaged)`` on success and raises ``OutputEnvelopeError``
(a ``ValueError``) when no JSON value can be recovered. Callers pick their
own failure policy (return ``None``, write a ``*_failed`` status patch, …),
and use ``salvaged`` to decide whether to rewrite a clean artefact file.
