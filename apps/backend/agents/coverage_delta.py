"""Coverage-delta primitive — Task 7 (#8) commit 2.

One of the FIVE evaluation signals the Evaluator (commit 5) will use
to score each generated test:

  coverage delta · 3× stability re-run · LLM semantic relevance ·
  mutate-and-check probe · flake-lint promotion

This module is *pure compute* — it consumes two Cobertura coverage
XML files (the format the Executor's DockerRunner already emits via
``--cov-report=xml``) and returns the set of lines newly covered by
running the second test on top of the first.

The Evaluator commit-5 wiring will:
  1. Read a baseline coverage XML (whole-project coverage from the
     base branch, or coverage from running the project's existing
     test suite — pluggable).
  2. For each generated test under spec_dir/tests/ run by the
     Executor, read its individual coverage XML.
  3. Call ``compute_delta(baseline_xml, after_xml)`` to get a
     ``CoverageDelta`` per generated test.

A weak test that exercises no new code paths gets a delta with
``new_lines == set()`` and ``delta_pct == 0.0`` — the Evaluator's
verdict logic uses this as one of its rejection signals.
