"""
Agent Tool Permissions
======================

Manages which tools are allowed for each agent type to prevent context
pollution and accidental misuse.

Supports dynamic tool filtering based on project capabilities to optimize
context window usage. For example, Playwright tools are only included for
web projects that need browser automation.

This module now uses AGENT_CONFIGS from models.py as the single source of truth
for tool permissions. The get_allowed_tools() function remains the primary API
for backwards compatibility.
