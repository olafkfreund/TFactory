## v0.2.0 release candidate — next step

All 16 v0.2 tasks merged to `main`. The next operator-controlled step is
tagging `v0.2.0` + cutting the GitHub Release. One follow-up PR is
outstanding (~50 lines): Task 16's deferred commit 4 — Triager
PR-comment evidence-links — which was held back during the parallel
batch because Task 11 hadn't landed yet. Task 11 is now on main, so the
follow-up is unblocked whenever someone picks it up.

## Test totals

| Snapshot | Backend tests | Δ vs prior | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| v0.1.0-mvp baseline (2026-05-28) | **531** | — | Walking skeleton — Python + pytest only |
| v0.2 in progress (post-batch-1, 2026-05-29) | **1039** (7 skipped) | **+508** | After 14 of 16 v0.2 tasks |
| v0.2 release candidate (HEAD, 2026-05-29) | **1170** (7 skipped) | **+131** | After all 16 v0.2 tasks — exceeded the +~110 forecast |

The 7 skips are the docker-runner smoke tests (#23) — they require a
live daemon and gracefully skip when none is present.

## Pipeline status

```
  Planner ─► Gen-Functional ─► Executor ─► Evaluator ─► Triager
  (polyglot   (generic via      (DockerRunner    (5 signals;     (catalog-aware
   per #21)    descriptor #22)   + AppRuntime     null coverage;  in #27, in flight;
                                  for Browser     TS primitives   dry-run by default)
                                  #24)            #25)
```

All four agents are running on `main`; the only remaining work is the
Triager catalog-lookup (#27), the lane grid + CLI polish (#31), and
evidence capture + viewer (#32).

## Health signals

- ✅ `scripts/verify-fork.sh --no-import` — passes against the v0.2 module set
- ✅ pytest (backend) — **1039 passed, 7 skipped** at HEAD `d2aa2ae`
- ✅ All 5 portal endpoints respond shim-compatibly without fastapi installed
- ✅ Pages site builds + deploys on every push to `main` (Cayman + custom layout)
- ⚪ Docker integration — runner images build under CI; per-image smoke
  tests skip locally without a daemon (recovers via `tfactory-test`)
- ⚪ End-to-end smoke (`scripts/e2e-smoke.sh`) — 9 scenarios, operator-driven
