# Remote MCP Server — non-Claude client access

> Same task-control plane as the stdio MCP server, different transport: an HTTP+SSE MCP server exposed by the TFactory web-server so non-Claude clients (Cursor, Continue.dev, custom scripts, programmatic users) can drive TFactory.

Sister doc to [`CLAUDE_CODE_MCP_TOOLS.md`](./CLAUDE_CODE_MCP_TOOLS.md) (stdio server for Claude Code in this repo). Same Epic (#50), different audience.

## Enabling

Off by default. Set the env var on your TFactory deployment:

```bash
TFACTORY_MCP_REMOTE_ENABLED=true
```

The routes mount only when this is truthy. Default deployments are completely unchanged — no new attack surface.

## Endpoints

| Path | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/mcp-remote/sse` | `GET` | SSE event stream — long-lived connection the MCP client subscribes to |
| `/api/mcp-remote/messages/` | `POST` | Client → server JSON-RPC message channel for the active SSE session |

Both require `Authorization: Bearer acw_<key>`.

## Auth model

The remote server validates **`acw_` API keys** (minted via the web UI), not the legacy admin bearer token. Each key carries **scopes**:

- `mcp:read` — for read tools (list / get / diff)
- `mcp:write` — for write tools (start / stop / approve / merge)

A key with only `mcp:read` calling `start_task` gets:

```
Error: API key lacks required scope 'mcp:write'. Mint a new key with the right scope via the web UI.
```

Why scopes (not just "is this key valid?"): scope-gating lets you give a Cursor session a read-only key to *observe* TFactory state from your editor without risking accidental task starts. The write-scope key is what you mint when you actually want to drive things.

### Minting a key

In the TFactory web UI:

1. Settings → API Keys → New key
2. Name: `Cursor (read-only)` or whatever helps you identify it
3. Scopes: tick `mcp:read` (and `mcp:write` if you want write access)
4. Save — the raw `acw_…` token is shown ONCE. Copy it to your client config.

## Client configuration

### Cursor

`~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tfactory-remote": {
      "url": "https://tfactory.example.com/api/mcp-remote/sse",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer acw_yourKeyHere"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Continue.dev

`~/.continue/config.json`:

```json
{
  "experimental": {
    "modelContextProtocolServer": {
      "transport": {
        "type": "sse",
        "url": "https://tfactory.example.com/api/mcp-remote/sse"
      },
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer acw_yourKeyHere"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Programmatic (Python `mcp` SDK)

```python
import os
from mcp.client.sse import sse_client

async with sse_client(
    "https://tfactory.example.com/api/mcp-remote/sse",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['TFACTORY_KEY']}"},
) as (read, write):
    # Now use mcp.ClientSession on (read, write)
    ...
```

| `tfactory.recover_task` | ✓ shipped | `mcp:write` | Wraps `POST /api/tasks/{id}/recover` |

**Full 12-tool catalog now shipped — Epic #50 complete.**

### Notes on the V1.1 additions

**`tail_agent_console` returns a URL, not a stream.** SSE-inside-MCP is awkward (the MCP envelope is request/response, SSE is push). Instead the tool returns the absolute SSE URL + a hint to use the same `Authorization` header — the client makes a separate GET against that URL and consumes the stream natively. The SSE endpoint emits `data:` lines as the agent's `build-progress.txt` grows, then closes with `event: done` on idle timeout (30s) or max duration (30min).

**`reject_plan` records feedback on the review-state log.** When `feedback` is supplied, it's appended to the spec's review-state feedback list so the planner's next iteration sees it. The plan file is flipped to `planStatus: "rejected"` for portal visibility.

## Architecture — how this fits with the stdio server

```

                          └──────────────────────────┘
```

Both servers expose the same conceptual surface (task control plane). They share the underlying REST endpoints — anything one can do, the other can do. The split is purely about transport + auth model:

| | stdio MCP | Remote HTTP+SSE MCP |
|---|---|---|
| Transport | stdin/stdout pipes | HTTP + SSE |
| Started by | Claude Code via `.mcp.json` | The TFactory web-server |
| Auth | Legacy admin bearer token (`~/.tfactory/.token`) | `acw_` API keys with `mcp:read`/`mcp:write` scopes |
| Audience | Claude Code in this repo | Cursor, Continue.dev, programmatic clients |
| Default | Always on (registered via `.mcp.json`) | Off (`TFACTORY_MCP_REMOTE_ENABLED=true`) |

## Error matrix

| Situation | What the client sees |
|---|---|
| Missing `Authorization` header | HTTP 401 + `{"error": "Missing or malformed Authorization header (expected 'Bearer <token>')"}` |
| Unknown key | HTTP 401 + `{"error": "Invalid API key"}` |
| Revoked key | HTTP 401 + `{"error": "API key has been revoked"}` |
| Insufficient scope | `content` block with `isError: true` + actionable message naming the missing scope |
| Tool not found | `content` block with `isError: true` + `"unknown tool: <name>"` |
| Backend HTTP error | `content` block with `isError: true` + truncated body |

Every error stays a single line, no stack traces.

## Security notes

- `acw_` keys are sha256-hashed at rest with an 8-char preview prefix. The raw token is shown only at creation time.
- `mcp:read` is enough to enumerate tasks across the install — treat it like read-only DB access.
- `mcp:write` can trigger paid LLM runs (`start_task`) and merge PRs (`merge_pr`). Treat it like a deploy key.
- Routes are reachable only when `TFACTORY_MCP_REMOTE_ENABLED=true`. The default deployment surface is unchanged.
