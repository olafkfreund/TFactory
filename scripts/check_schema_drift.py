"""Fail CI when the vendored Task Contract schema drifts from the canonical one.

The canonical RFC-0002 schema lives in the Factory hub
(``apis/task-contract.schema.json``); TFactory vendors a copy at
``apps/backend/contracts/task-contract-v2.schema.json`` for offline reference.
This guard (ported from PFactory's identical gate, TFactory #679) stops the
copy silently going stale again.

The check is **directional**: canonical <= vendored. Every property, ``$def``
and enum value the canonical defines must exist in the vendored copy (vendored
may carry extra, intentional additions), so any contract valid under the
canonical schema stays valid under the vendored one. Descriptions are ignored.

Usage:
    python scripts/check_schema_drift.py                 # fetch canonical from main
    python scripts/check_schema_drift.py --canonical PATH_OR_URL
    python scripts/check_schema_drift.py --ref <git-ref>

Only a *transient* network failure fetching the canonical schema is a SOFT SKIP
(loud warning, exit 0) so a GitHub outage can't red the build. A deterministic
failure - a TLS/certificate error, a 404, malformed JSON - fails hard (exit 1):
it recurs on every run, so soft-skipping it would leave this gate permanently
green while never once running, and a silent skip is indistinguishable from a
pass (Factory#433). Real drift also fails hard (exit 1).
